# Optimal Ambulance Location Allocation for Emergency Response Optimization

## Project Overview
This project optimizes the location allocation of ambulances for more efficient emergency response. The solution involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and the application of optimization techniques. 

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following scripts:
- **data_preprocessing.py**: Preprocesses and cleans the raw dataset.
- **eda.py**: Performs exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
- **baseline_model.py**: Implements a baseline model for comparison.
- **optimization_model.py**: Defines and solves the optimization problem for ambulance allocation.
- **model_implementation.py**: Implements the final model based on the optimization.
- **model_validation.py**: Validates and evaluates the model's performance.
- **requirements.txt**: Contains the necessary Python libraries to run the project.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You will also need to install the required dependencies.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ambulance-optimization
    ```

3. Install the necessary Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

python 3.0 x

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib/Seaborn

Scikit-learn

PuLP
    ```

## Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the individual scripts sequentially. Each script corresponds to a specific step of the project pipeline.

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    Clean and preprocess the raw dataset by running:
    ```bash
   data_preprocessing.ipynb
    ```

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and visualize patterns:
    ```bash
    eda.ipynb
    ```

3. **Baseline Model**:
    Build and evaluate a baseline model to compare with more advanced optimization models:
    ```bash
    baseline_model.ipynb
    ```

4. **Optimization Model**:
    Define and solve the optimization problem for ambulance allocation:
    ```bash
    optimization_model.ipynb
    ```

5. **Model Implementation**:
    Implement the final model using the formulated optimization model:
    ```bash
    model_implementation.ipynb
    ```

6. **Model Validation**:
    Validate and evaluate the modelâ€™s performance based on predefined metrics:
    ```bash
    model_validation.ipynb
    ```

## Results
After running the scripts, you will get the optimal ambulance locations and allocation strategy. The results will be provided in the form of:
- **Optimal locations** for ambulance stations.
- **Performance metrics** including response time, coverage, and efficiency.
- **Comparisons** between the baseline model and the optimized solution.
